# The Runner - classic arcade game clone

## What is The Runner?

That's a funny arcade game. You have to cross the roads and reach the water. Once a bug gets you - you lose a life. When you lose
all of your lives, you have to play again.

## Instructions

* You can use the arrow keys to move.
* Your goal is to reach the water - every time you reach the water you get 10 points.
* The game ends when you lose your lives.

## How it's made?


The starting code is from Udacity's Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree Program. I used HTML, CSS, JS to:
* manipulate the DOM;
* create the classes, the new objects and add their methods
* add a points counter, lives counter and a replay button;
* create popup modal at the end of the game;
* change some styles and make the game responsive;

## Good luck and have fun!!!
